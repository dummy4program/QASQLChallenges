World Challenge SQL
1. Using COUNT , get the number of cities in the USA

SELECT CountryCode AS Country, COUNT(name) AS "Number of cities"
FROM city
WHERE CountryCode = "USA";

2. Find out the population and life expectancy for people in Argentina

SELECT Name AS Country, Population, LifeExpectancy AS "Life Expectancy (years)"
FROM Country
WHERE Name = "Argentina";

3. Using IS NOT NULL , ORDER BY , and LIMIT , which country has the highest life expectancy?

SELECT Name AS Country, LifeExpectancy AS "Life Expectancy (years)"
FROM Country
WHERE LifeExpectancy IS NOT NULL
ORDER BY LifeExpectancy DESC
LIMIT 1;

4. Using JOIN ... ON , find the capital city of Spain.

SELECT city.ID AS "City ID", city.Name AS "Capital City", city.CountryCode AS Country
FROM city
JOIN country ON city.ID = country.capital
WHERE country.Name = "Spain";

5. Using JOIN ... ON , list all the languages spoken in the Southeast Asia region.

SELECT DISTINCT countrylanguage.Language, country.Region
FROM countrylanguage
JOIN country ON countrylanguage.CountryCode = country.Code
WHERE country.Region = "Southeast Asia"
ORDER BY countrylanguage.Language ASC;

6. Using a single query, list 25 cities around the world that start with the letter F.

SELECT Name AS City, CountryCode AS Country
FROM City
WHERE Name LIKE "F%"
LIMIT 25;

	or to ensure the cities are more strictly from "around the world" by only listing a maximum of one city from an individual city, the following can be used:

SELECT Name AS City, CountryCode AS Country
FROM City
WHERE Name LIKE "F%"
GROUP BY CountryCode
LIMIT 25;

7. Using COUNT and JOIN ... ON , get the number of cities in China.

SELECT country.Name AS Country, COUNT(city.CountryCode) AS "Number of cities"
FROM city
JOIN country ON city.CountryCode = country.Code
WHERE country.Name = "China";

8.  Using IS NOT NULL , ORDER BY , and LIMIT , which country has the lowest population? Discard non-zero populations

SELECT Name AS Country, Population
FROM country
WHERE Population = (
	SELECT MIN(Population)
	FROM country
	WHERE Population IS NOT NULL
	AND Population != 0
	);

	or the quick/cheat version

SELECT Name AS Country, Population
FROM country
WHERE Population IS NOT NULL
AND Population != 0
ORDER BY Population ASC
LIMIT 1;

9. Using aggregate functions, return the number of countries the database contains.

SELECT COUNT(DISTINCT Code) AS "Number of countries"
FROM country;

	Although I believe the above statement gives the correct answer number, it's not technically searching the whole database to get that number.

	Unsuccesful attempts to code a statement to search all tables in the database and achieve the relevant answer are below:

SELECT COUNT(DISTINCT C1, C2, C3)
FROM (
	SELECT DISTINCT CountryCode
	FROM city
	) as C1,
	(
	SELECT DISTINCT Code
	FROM country
	) as C2,
	(
	SELECT DISTINCT CountryCode
	FROM countrylanguage
	) as C3
	;

SELECT MAX(C1, C2, C3)
FROM (
	SELECT COUNT(DISTINCT CountryCode)
	FROM city
	) as C1,
	(
	SELECT COUNT(DISTINCT Code)
	FROM country
	) as C2,
	(
	SELECT COUNT(DISTINCT CountryCode)
	FROM countrylanguage
	) as C3
	;


10. What are the top ten largest countries by area?

SELECT Name AS Country, SurfaceArea AS Area
FROM country
ORDER BY SurfaceArea DESC
LIMIT 10;

11. List the five largest cities by population in Japan.

SELECT city.Name AS "City in Japan", country.Name AS Country, city.Population
FROM city
JOIN country
ON city.CountryCode = country.Code
WHERE country.Name = "Japan"
ORDER BY city.Population DESC
LIMIT 5;

12. List the names and country codes of every country with Elizabeth II as its Head of State. You will need to fix the mistake first

UPDATE country
SET HeadOfState = "Elizabeth II"
WHERE HeadOfState = "Elisabeth II";

SELECT Name AS Country, Code AS "Country Code", HeadOfState AS "Head of State"
FROM country
WHERE HeadOfState LIKE "%Elizabeth%II%";

13. List the top ten countries with the smallest population-to-area ratio. Discard any countries with a ratio of 0

SELECT Name AS Country, Population, SurfaceArea AS Area, Population / SurfaceArea AS "Population-to-area ratio"
FROM country
WHERE Population / SurfaceArea != 0
ORDER BY Population / SurfaceArea ASC
LIMIT 10;

14. List every unique world language

SELECT DISTINCT Language
FROM countrylanguage
ORDER BY language ASC;

	or alternatively:

SELECT Language
FROM countrylanguage
GROUP BY language
ORDER BY language ASC;

	This returns 457 results. Although the data values are technically unique, the languages are not as some overlap each other e.g. "Russian" and "Ukrainian" are both also featured in the value "Ukrainian and Russian".

	Unsuccessful attempt to write a statement to eliminate overlapping results is below:

SELECT DISTINCT Language
FROM countrylanguage
WHERE Language NOT LIKE %Language%
ORDER BY Language ASC;


15. List the names and GNP of the world's top 10 richest countries.

SELECT Name AS Country, GNP AS "Y'arrgggh, gold doubloons!"
FROM country
ORDER BY GNP DESC
LIMIT 10;

16.  List the names of, and number of languages spoken by, the top ten most multilingual countries.

SELECT country.Name AS Country, COUNT(countrylanguage.language) AS "Languages spoken"
FROM countrylanguage
JOIN country
ON countrylanguage.CountryCode = country.Code
GROUP BY countrylanguage.CountryCode
ORDER BY COUNT(countrylanguage.language) DESC
LIMIT 10;

17. List every country where over 50% of its population can speak German.

SELECT country.Name AS Country, countrylanguage.Language, countrylanguage.Percentage AS "Percentage of population able to speak"
FROM countrylanguage
JOIN country
ON countrylanguage.CountryCode = country.Code
WHERE countrylanguage.Language LIKE "%German%"
AND countrylanguage.Percentage > "50";

18.  Which country has the worst life expectancy? Discard zero or null values.

SELECT Name AS Country, LifeExpectancy AS "Life Expectancy"
FROM country
WHERE LifeExpectancy = (
	SELECT MIN(LifeExpectancy)
	FROM country
	WHERE LifeExpectancy IS NOT NULL
	AND LifeExpectancy != 0
	);

19. List the top three most common government forms.

SELECT GovernmentForm AS "Government Form", COUNT(GovernmentForm) AS Frequency
FROM country
GROUP BY GovernmentForm
ORDER BY COUNT(GovernmentForm) DESC
LIMIT 3;

20. How many countries have gained independence since records began?

SELECT COUNT(IndepYear) AS "Number of countries who have gained independence"
FROM country;

	Could add WHERE IndepYear IS NOT NULL to this but MySQL only counts non null values by default (from testing and StackOverflow).

	As COUNT won't directly count NULL fields, the following can be used to count records which contain a NULL value in the IndepYear column as a workaround: SELECT COUNT(*) FROM country WHERE IndepYear IS NULL; this can then be subtracted from the total records (count of country names) to double check the above solution is correct.

	This question is also ambigiuous - what specific records and when are they meant to have started? Do we assume that knowing any date, even a "before AD" date (a minus value in the database) is still technically recorded because it is known as a specific date, or do we go from 0? So the above solution is based on the interpretation that ANY date (any NOT NULL value) needs to be counted.
